# jgGrid Binding

A grid binding plugin for Knockout.js provides basic integration with the JqGrid plugin for jQuery.

Features include: Binding to an observable array of items, progressive enhancement of an existing table (using an extension of the jqgrid tabletogrid feature), selected item and mulit-select items binding, and templated column support.

##Usage

The grid binding plug uses the markup of the table to internally derive an appropriate column model for jqgrid to work upon. The data-field attribute denotes the property of each array item to bind a column to, and its header text will carry into the rendered table. A th element is required for each column desired in the rendered table. Optionally, a template can be specified for any column by providing a binding template for the column inside of the tbody element. NB: any inline column widths/styles will be carried into jqgrids column model, and applied to the resultant grid.
